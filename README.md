Downloadable data in .ttl format from the Pompeii Linked Open Data (P-LOD) initiative.

Everything here is in its earliest stages. Read more about the project at http://p-lod.org/ .

P-LOD is an ongoing project and the data here will grow. Much of what is here now was collected as part of the Pompeii Artistic Landscape Project (PALP), generously funded by the Getty Foundation, or as part of the Pompeii Bibliography and Mapping Project (PBMP), funded by the NEH. PALP is browseable at http://palp.art and PBMP is online at https://digitalhumanities.umass.edu/pbmp/.
